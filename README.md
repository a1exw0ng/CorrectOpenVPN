# CorrectOpenVPN
Fixes OpenVPN Connect crash on iOS 8 when non-OpenVPN VPNs are used.

Mainly based on a research made by saurik, which is mostly correct:

Thank you very much, you eased my work a lot.

The source code is fairly ugly but it works for me (and was originally
designed to work only for me). If you dislike it, feel free to make a 
pull request. I decided to release the tweak and its source because 
neither iOS 8.3 nor OpenVPN itself are fixing anything  for some time
already :/

You may grab the binary for your repos.
